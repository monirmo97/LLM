## GPT-2 Fine-Tuning with LoRa and QLoRa

**Project Overview:**

    This project aims to fine-tune the GPT-2 language model using two efficient adaptation techniques: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRa). These methods significantly reduce the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning, making the process more memory-efficient and computationally feasible, even on hardware with limited resources.

## Goals

    Fine-tune GPT-2 on the Wikitext-2 dataset: Utilize a subset of the Wikitext-2 dataset to train and evaluate the GPT-2 model.

**Implement LoRa and QLoRa:**
    Apply these adaptation techniques to reduce the fine-tuning cost by decomposing the weight updates into low-rank matrices and using quantization.

**Evaluate Performance:** 
    Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, perplexity, and loss.

## Key Components

**Data Preparation:**

    Load the Wikitext-2 dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
    Tokenize the text data using the GPT-2 tokenizer, ensuring the input sequences are appropriately padded and truncated.

**LoRa and QLoRa Implementation:**

    LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation): Decompose the weight updates into low-rank matrices, reducing the number of parameters to be updated.
    QLoRa (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation): Extend LoRa by applying quantization to the low-rank matrices, further reducing memory usage.

**Model Fine-Tuning:**

    Fine-tune GPT-2 using the tokenized dataset, applying LoRa or QLoRa to specific layers of the model.
    Freeze all other layers to limit the number of parameters being updated.

**Evaluation:**

    Evaluate the fine-tuned model using accuracy, perplexity, and loss metrics to measure its performance on the test dataset.

**Usage:**

Libraries: torch, transformers, datasets, numpy, bitsandbytes

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa):
LoRa decomposes the weight updates into two smaller matrices, lora_a and lora_b, whose product approximates the original weight update. This approach reduces the number of parameters and the computational cost of fine-tuning.

Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRa):
QLoRa extends LoRa by applying quantization techniques to the low-rank matrices. Using lower precision (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit integers) for the matrices further reduces the memory footprint while maintaining model performance.

## Performance Metrics:

    Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.

    Perplexity: Evaluates how well the model predicts a sample, with lower values indicating better performance.

    Loss: The cross-entropy loss between the predicted and actual labels.

## Conclusion:

    This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LoRa and QLoRa in fine-tuning large language models like GPT-2 efficiently. By reducing the number of parameters and utilizing quantization, these techniques make it feasible to adapt large models even on hardware with limited resources. The approach provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained environments.
