# GPT-2 Language Model Training and Evaluation

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune and evaluate a GPT-2 language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The goal is to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on the Wikitext dataset and evaluate it using loss, perplexity, and accuracy metrics and  the model is trained to perform next-token prediction. The model will be saved based on the best evaluation performance.

# Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-2 are powerful tools for natural language processing tasks. This project guides you through the process of:

    1. Setting up the environment. 

    2. Preparing and tokenizing the dataset.

    3. Training the GPT-2 model.

    4. Evaluating the model using custom metrics (loss, perplexity, accuracy).

    5. Saving the best model based on evaluation performance.

# Setup and Installation:

    Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.

    Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    pip install Requirements.txt

# Data Preparation:

    Load and Split Dataset: The Wikitext dataset is used for training and evaluation. It is split into training and testing sets.

    Tokenize the Dataset: Convert text into tokens that the GPT-2 model can understand.

# Model Training:

    Load the Model: Load the pre-trained GPT-2 model.

    Define Custom Metrics: Calculate loss, perplexity, and accuracy during evaluation.

    Training Arguments and Trainer: Set up the training arguments and initialize the Trainer.

# Evaluation:

    Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the trained model using the test dataset and print the results.

# Challenges:
    1. Data Preparation: Ensuring the data is clean, properly formatted, and tokenized correctly can be complex.

    2. Computational Resources: Training LLMs like GPT-2 can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and memory.

    3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Finding the optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) can be challenging and time-consuming.

    4. Model Compatibility: Ensuring that all dependencies and libraries are compatible with each other.

    5. Evaluation Metrics: Implementing custom metrics like perplexity and accuracy can add complexity to the evaluation process.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a GPT-2 language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. By following the steps outlined above, you can set up your environment, prepare data, train the model, and evaluate its performance using custom metrics.
